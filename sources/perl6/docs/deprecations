Deprecations in 2012.11

    at present, a reference to an &foo that does not exist evalutes to
    Nil. This will become a CHECK-time failure, in line with STD.
    Planned for the 2012.12 release.

Deprecations in 2012.10

    protos for built-in routines are now mostly as generic as possible,
    and will be changed to be specific to the arity of the routine.
    For example 'proto sub chr(|) {*}' will become 'proto sub chr($) {*}'
    This affects everybody who adds multis with unusual arity to built-in
    subs.
    Planned for the 2012.11 release.

    Unary hyper ops currently descend into nested arrays and hashes.
    This will change to make them equivalent to a one-level map.
    Planned for the 2012.11 release.

    ~/.perl6/lib will go away from the default include path (@*INC).
    Instead %*CUSTOM_LIB now holds paths to four library locations:
        perl    Rakudo installs its core modules here
        vendor  OS-level package managers should install their modules here
        site    for local module installations (e.g. with panda or ufo)
        home    like site, but always under the user's home directory.
                fallback if site isn't writable.
    Removal of ~/.perl6/lib from @*INC planned for the 2012.11 release


Deprecations in 2012.09

    Str.capitalize and &capitalize are deprecated in favor
    of the the Str.wordcase and &wordcase routines.
    They will uncondtionally warn in 2012.10, and be removed in 2012.11.

Deprecations in 2012.08

    Parameters preceeded by a | or \ may not have a sigil anymore.
        sub f(\$x) { say $x }
    must be changed to 
        sub f(\x) { say x }
    Usage of \$x will unconditionally warn in 2012.09 and be removed in 2012.10

    IO::Path.dir (which returns the directory part of the path)
    has been renamed to IO::Path.directory.
    IO::Path.dir will be removed or re-purposed in 2012.09

    The LAZY statement prefix will be removed in 2012.09. It was a non-specced
    experiment and did not work out well.
