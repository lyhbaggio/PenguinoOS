----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.1 (rgerhards), 2012-04-16
- fixed configure.ac in regard to math lib
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.0 (rgerhards), 2012-02-21
- rename convert tool to prevent name clash with ImageMagick's tool
- support for decoding json added
- bugfix: ee_newFieldFromNV() did not work correctly
  value was set, but number of values were not corrected, this the
  value could not be used (looked like non-present)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.2 (rgerhards), 2011-11-22
- API enhancements:
  * added capability to enumerate tags inside a tagbucket
  * added capability to obtain tagbucket for an event
    --> ee_EventGetTagbucket()
  * added capability to add a string value to a field in one call
    --> ee_addStrValueToField()
  * added ee_getTag(), ee_setTags()
- added additional parser
  * RFC5424Date
- potentially problematic API change: in earlier versions, the 
  function ee_TagbucketHasTag() was errornously name ee_BucketHasTag().
  This has been corrected, potentially resulting in API
  incompatibility. We have accepted this, because we are at level 0.x
  AND know that potentially no current user has ever used this
  function, but instead the upper-layer equivalents. But if thinks
  break, you now know why ;)
- flat tags are no longer encoded in the CEE encoders as CEE does not
  support flat tags. However, this can be turned on via context flags,
  if desired
- bugfix: compile problems under Solaris
  closes: http://bugzilla.adiscon.com/show_bug.cgi?id=253
- bugfix: ee_EventGetTagbucket() always returned -1 (error)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.1 (rgerhards), 2011-04-18
- API extensions
- brought tag handling a bit inline with upcoming 0.6 draft CEE spec
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.0 (rgerhards), 2011-04-06
- extended API
- added support for tags
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.0 (rgerhards), 2011-04-01
- added additional parsers
  * Time12hr
  * Time24hr
  * ISODate
  * QuotedString
- added CSV encoder (very experimental)
- removed dependency on libxml (which we currently do not need)
