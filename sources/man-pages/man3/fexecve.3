.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR fexecve ()
performs the same task as
.BR execve (2),
with the difference that the file to be executed
is specified via a file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
rather than via a pathname.
The file descriptor
.I fd
must be opened read-only,
and the caller must have permission to execute the file that it refers to.
.\" POSIX.1-2008 specifies the O_EXEC flag for open as an alternative,
.\" but Linux doesn't support this flag yet.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
A successful call to
.BR fexecve ()
never returns.
On error, the function returns, with a result value of \-1, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Errors are as for
.BR execve (2),
with the following additions:
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor, or
.I argv
is NULL, or
.I envp
is NULL.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The
.I /proc
file system could not be accessed.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR fexecve ()
is implemented since glibc 2.3.2.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
POSIX.1-2008.
This function is not specified in POSIX.1-2001,
and is not widely available on other systems.
.SH NOTES
On Linux,
.BR fexecve ()
is implemented using the
.BR proc (5)
file system, so
.I /proc
needs to be mounted and available at the time of the call.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR execve (2)
