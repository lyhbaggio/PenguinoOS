.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR copysign ()
functions return a value whose absolute value matches
that of \fIx\fP, but whose sign bit matches that of \fIy\fP.

For example,
.I "copysign(42.0,\ \-1.0)"
and
.I "copysign(\-42.0, \-1.0)"
both return \-42.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return a value whose magnitude is taken from
.I x
and whose sign is taken from
.IR y .

If \fIx\fP is a NaN,
a NaN with the sign bit of \fIy\fP is returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors occur.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" 4.3BSD.
This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appendix with
recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
.SH NOTES
On architectures where the floating-point formats are not IEEE 754 compliant,
the
.BR copysign ()
functions may treat a negative zero as positive.
