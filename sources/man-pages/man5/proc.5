.TH PROC 5 2012-11-24 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
proc \- process information pseudo-file system
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I proc
file system is a pseudo-file system which is used as an interface to
kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at
.IR /proc .
Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be
changed.
.LP
The following outline gives a quick tour through the
.I /proc
hierarchy.
.PD 1
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]
There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the
subdirectory is named by the process ID.
Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/attr and
.\"       /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/attr
.\"	  This is a directory
.\"       Added in ???
.\"	  CONFIG_SECURITY
.\"
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/auxv " (since 2.6.0-test7)"
This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter information passed
to the process at exec time.
The format is one \fIunsigned long\fP ID
plus one \fIunsigned long\fP value for each entry.
The last entry contains two zeros.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/cgroup " (since Linux 2.6.24)"
.\" 	  Info in Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt
This file describes control groups to which the process/task belongs.
For each cgroup hierarchy there is one entry containing
colon-separated fields of the form:
.nf
.ft CW

    5:cpuacct,cpu,cpuset:/daemons
.ft
.fi
.IP
The colon-separated fields are, from left to right:
.RS 11
.IP 1. 3
hierarchy ID number
.IP 2.
set of subsystems bound to the hierarchy
.IP 3.
control group in the hierarchy to which the process belongs
.RE
.IP
This file is only present if the
.B CONFIG_CGROUPS
kernel configuration option is enabled.
.\"
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/clear_refs
.\"       Added in 2.6.22
.\"       "Clears page referenced bits shown in smaps output"
.\"       write-only
.\"       CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cmdline
This holds the complete command line for the process,
unless the process is a zombie.
.\" In 2.3.26, this also used to be true if the process was swapped out.
In the latter case, there is nothing in this file:
that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters.
The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of
strings separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
with a further null byte after the last string.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter " (since kernel 2.6.23)"
See
.BR core (5).
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/cpuset " (since kernel 2.6.12)"
.\" and/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/cpuset
See
.BR cpuset (7).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cwd
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.
To find out the current working directory of process 20,
for instance, you can do this:

.in +4n
.nf
.RB "$" " cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd"
.fi
.in

Note that the
.I pwd
command is often a shell built-in, and might
not work properly.
In
.BR bash (1),
you may use
.IR "pwd\ \-P" .

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/environ
This file contains the environment for the process.
The entries are separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
and there may be a null byte at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:
.in +4n
.nf

.ft CW
.RB "$" " (cat /proc/1/environ; echo) | tr \(aq\e000\(aq \(aq\en\(aq"
.fi
.ft P
.in
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open
it will open the executable.
You can even type
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
to run another copy of the same executable as is being run by
process [pid].
.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Under Linux 2.0 and earlier
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
is a pointer to the binary which was executed,
and appears as a symbolic link.
A
.BR readlink (2)
call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:

    [device]:inode

For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE,
MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).

.BR find (1)
with the
.I \-inum
option can be used to locate the file.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/fd
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a
symbolic link to the actual file.
Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, etc.

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Programs that will take a filename as a command-line argument,
but will not take input from standard input if no argument is supplied,
or that write to a file named as a command-line argument,
but will not send their output to standard output
if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use
standard input or standard out using
.IR /proc/[pid]/fd .
For example, assuming that
.I \-i
is the flag designating an input file and
.I \-o
is the flag designating an output file:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /proc/self/fd/0 \-o /proc/self/fd/1 ..."
.fi
.in

and you have a working filter.
.\" The following is not true in my tests (MTK):
.\" Note that this will not work for
.\" programs that seek on their files, as the files in the fd directory
.\" are not seekable.

.I /proc/self/fd/N
is approximately the same as
.I /dev/fd/N
in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link
.I /dev/fd
to
.IR /proc/self/fd ,
in fact.

Most systems provide symbolic links
.IR /dev/stdin ,
.IR /dev/stdout ,
and
.IR /dev/stderr ,
which respectively link to the files
.IR 0 ,
.IR 1 ,
and
.IR 2
in
.IR /proc/self/fd .
Thus the example command above could be written as:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /dev/stdin \-o /dev/stdout ..."
.fi
.in
.\" FIXME Describe /proc/[pid]/loginuid
.\"       Added in 2.6.11; updating requires CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL
.\"       CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/fdinfo/ " (since kernel 2.6.22)"
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor.
The contents of each file can be read to obtain information
about the corresponding file descriptor, for example:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4"
pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
.fi
.in

The
.I pos
field is a decimal number showing the current file offset.
The
.I flags
field is an octal number that displays the
file access mode and file status flags (see
.BR open (2)).

The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process.
.\" FIXME document /proc/[pid]/io
.\" .TP
.\" .IR /proc/[pid]/io " (since kernel 2.6.20)"
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/limits " (since kernel 2.6.24)"
This file displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units of measurement
for each of the process's resource limits (see
.BR getrlimit (2)).
Up to and including Linux 2.6.35,
this file is protected to only allow reading by the real UID of the process.
Since Linux 2.6.36,
.\" commit 3036e7b490bf7878c6dae952eec5fb87b1106589
this file is readable file is readable
by all users on the system.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/maps
A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and their access
permissions.

The format is:

.nf
.ft CW

bffff000-c0000000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0
.ft
.fi

where "address" is the address space in the process that it occupies,
"perms" is a set of permissions:

.nf
.in +5
r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)
.fi
.in

"offset" is the offset into the file/whatever, "dev" is the device
(major:minor), and "inode" is the inode on that device.
0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region,
as the case would be with BSS (uninitialized data).

Under Linux 2.0 there is no field giving pathname.

.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj " (since Linux 2.6.11)"
This file can be used to adjust the score used to select which process
should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM) situation.
The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift operation of the process's
.IR oom_score
value:
valid values are in the range \-16 to +15,
plus the special value \-17,
which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.
A positive score increases the likelihood of this
process being killed by the OOM-killer;
a negative score decreases the likelihood.
The default value for this file is 0;
a new process inherits its parent's
.I oom_adj
setting.
A process must be privileged
.RB ( CAP_SYS_RESOURCE )
to update this file.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_score " (since Linux 2.6.11)"
.\" See mm/oom_kill.c::badness() in the 2.6.25 sources
This file displays the current score that the kernel gives to
this process for the purpose of selecting a process
for the OOM-killer.
A higher score means that the process is more likely to be
selected by the OOM-killer.
The basis for this score is the amount of memory used by the process,
with increases (+) or decreases (\-) for factors including:
.\" See mm/oom_kill.c::badness() in the 2.6.25 sources

\fIpriority\fP %ld
(Explanation for Linux 2.6)
For processes running a real-time scheduling policy
.RI ( policy
below; see
.BR sched_setscheduler (2)),
this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one;
that is, a number in the range \-2 to \-100,
corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99.
For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
this is the raw nice value
.RB ( setpriority (2))
as represented in the kernel.
The kernel stores nice values as numbers
in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),
corresponding to the user-visible nice range of \-20 to 19.

Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
the scheduler weighting given to this process.
.\" And back in kernel 1.2 days things were different again.
.TP
\fInice\fP %ld
The nice value (see

.IR /proc/[pid]/task " (since Linux 2.6.0-test6)"
This is a directory that contains one subdirectory
for each thread in the process.
The name of each subdirectory is the numerical thread ID
.RI ( [tid] )
of the thread (see
.BR gettid (2)).
Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of
files with the same names and contents as under the
.I /proc/[pid]
directories.
For attributes that are shared by all threads, the contents for
each of the files under the
.I task/[tid]
subdirectories will be the same as in the corresponding
file in the parent
.I /proc/[pid]
directory
(e.g., in a multithreaded process, all of the
.I task/[tid]/cwd
files will have the same value as the
.I /proc/[pid]/cwd
file in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a process
share a working directory).
For attributes that are distinct for each thread,
the corresponding files under
.I task/[tid]
may have different values (e.g., various fields in each of the
.I task/[tid]/status
files may be different for each thread).

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
.I /proc/[pid]/task
directory are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).
.TP

.TP
.IR /proc/config.gz " (since Linux 2.6)"
This file exposes the configuration options that were used
to build the currently running kernel,
in the same format as they would be shown in the
.I .config
file that resulted when configuring the kernel (using
.IR "make xconfig" ,
.IR "make config" ,
or similar).
The file contents are compressed; view or search them using
.BR zcat (1),

.TP
.I /proc/filesystems
A text listing of the file systems which are supported by the kernel,
namely file systems which were compiled into the kernel or whose kernel
modules are currently loaded.
(See also
.BR filesystems (5).)
If a file system is marked with "nodev",
this means that it does not require a block device to be mounted
(e.g., virtual file system, network file system).

Incidentally, this file may be used by
.BR mount (8)
when no file system is specified and it didn't manage to determine the
file system type.
Then file systems contained in this file are tried
(excepted those that are marked with "nodev").
.TP
.I /proc/fs

.I /proc/interrupts
This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.
Since Linux 2.6.24,
for the i386 and x86_64 architectures, at least, this also includes
interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated with a device
as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt),
and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.
.TP
.I /proc/iomem

.IR /proc/kallsyms " (since Linux 2.5.71)"
This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the
.BR modules (X)
tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules.
In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly different syntax
was named
.IR ksyms .
.TP
.I /proc/kcore
This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored
in the ELF core file format.
With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped
kernel
.RI ( /usr/src/linux/vmlinux )
binary, GDB can be used to
examine the current state of any kernel data structures.

The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus
4KB.
.TP
.I /proc/kmsg
This file can be used instead of the
.BR syslog (2)
system call to read kernel messages.
A process must have superuser
privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this
file.
This file should not be read if a syslog process is running
which uses the
.BR syslog (2)
system call facility to log kernel messages.

Information in this file is retrieved with the
.BR dmesg (1)
program.
.TP
.IR /proc/ksyms " (Linux 1.1.23-2.5.47)"
See
.IR /proc/kallsyms .
.TP
.I /proc/loadavg
The first three fields in this file are load average figures
giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R)
or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
They are the same as the load average numbers given by
.BR uptime (1)
and other programs.
The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel
scheduling entities (processes, threads).
The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities
that currently exist on the system.
The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most
recently created on the system.
.TP
.I /proc/locks

.RB ( fcntl (2)).
.TP
.IR /proc/malloc " (only up to and including Linux 2.2)"
.\" It looks like this only ever did something back in 1.0 days
This file is only present if
.B CONFIG_DEBUG_MALLOC
was defined during compilation.
.TP
.I /proc/meminfo
This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
It is used by
.BR free (1)
to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap)
on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the
kernel.
Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon,
the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").
The list below describes the parameter names and
the format specifier required to read the field value.
Except as noted below,
all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0.
Some fileds are only displayed if the kernel was configured
with various options; those dependencies are noted in the list.
.RS
.TP
.IR MemTotal " %lu"
Total usable RAM (i.e. physical RAM minus a few reserved
bits and the kernel binary code).
.TP
.IR MemFree " %lu"

.TP
.IR Cached " %lu"
In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache).
Doesn't include
.IR SwapCached .
.TP
.IR SwapCached " %lu"
Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but
still also is in the swap file.
(If memory pressure is high, these pages
don't need to be swapped out again because they are already
in the swap file.
This saves I/O.)
.TP
.IR Active " %lu"
Memory that has been used more recently and usually not
reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.

.IR HighTotal " %lu"
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Total amount of highmem.
Highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory.
Highmem areas are for use by user-space programs,
or for the page cache.
The kernel must use tricks to access
this memory, making it slower to access than lowmem.
.TP

Amount of free highmem.
.TP
.IR LowTotal " %lu

Total amount of lowmem.
Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that
highmem can be used for, but it is also available for the
kernel's use for its own data structures.
Among many other things,
it is where everything from
.I Slab
is allocated.
Bad things happen when you're out of lowmem.

.IR CommitLimit " %lu (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Based on the overcommit ratio ('vm.overcommit_ratio'),
this is the total amount of  memory currently available to
be allocated on the system. This limit is only adhered to
if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio ).
The
.I CommitLimit
is calculated using the following formula:

    CommitLimit = (overcommit_ratio * Physical RAM) + Swap

For example, on a system with 1GB of physical RAM and 7GB
of swap with a
.I overcommit_ratio
of 30, this formula yields a
.I CommitLimit
of 7.3GB.
For more details, see the memory overcommit documentation
in the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting .
.TP
.IR Committed_AS " %lu"
The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.
The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which
has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been
"used" by them as of yet.
A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using
.BR malloc (3)
or similar), but only touches 300MB of that memory will only show up
as using 300MB of memory even if it has the address space
allocated for the entire 1GB.
This 1GB is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM
and can be used at any time by the allocating application.
With strict overcommit enabled on the system (mode 2
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory ),
allocations which would exceed the
.I CommitLimit
(detailed above) will not be permitted.
This is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will not
fail due to lack of memory once that memory has been successfully allocated.

Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and the "HW type"
is the hardware type of the address from RFC\ 826.
The flags are the internal

Setting the value to 1
prevents a longstanding class of security issues caused by

The common method of exploiting this flaw
is to cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link
(i.e., a root process follows a hard link created by another user).
Additionally, on systems without separated partitions,
this stops unauthorized users from "pinning" vulnerable set-user-ID and
set-group-ID files against being upgraded by
the administrator, or linking to special files.

The value in this file determines whether core dump files are
produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries.
Three different integer values can be specified:
.sp
\fI0\ (default)\fP
This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior.
A core dump will not be produced for a process which has
changed credentials (by calling
.BR seteuid (2),
.BR setgid (2),
or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program)
or whose binary does not have read permission enabled.
.sp
\fI1\ ("debug")\fP
All processes dump core when possible.
The core dump is owned by the file system user ID of the dumping process
and no security is applied.
This is intended for system debugging situations only.
Ptrace is unchecked.
.sp
\fI2\ ("suidsafe")\fP
Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see "0" above)
is dumped readable by root only.
This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it.
For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one
another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when administrators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.

the CPU that the task is scheduled on,
oom_adj score (see the description of

Such systems should not be forced to incur a performance penalty in

This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that
frees up a large amount of memory when killed.

where SS is the size of the swap space, and RAM
is the size of the physical memory, and r is the contents of the file
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio .
.TP
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
See the description of
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory .

.IR /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom " (since Linux 2.6.18)"
.\" The following is adapted from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables a kernel panic in
an out-of-memory situation.

If this file is set to the value 0,
the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process.
Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the
system will survive.

If this file is set to the value 1,
then the kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens.
However, if a process limits allocations to certain nodes
using memory policies
.RB ( mbind  (2)
.BR MPOL_BIND )
or cpusets
.RB ( cpuset (7))
and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status,
one process may be killed by the OOM-killer.
No panic occurs in this case:
because other nodes' memory may be free,
this means the system as a whole may not have reached
an out-of-memory situation yet.

If this file is set to the value 2,
the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

The default value is 0.
1 and 2 are for failover of clustering.
Select either according to your policy of failover.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
The value in this file controls how aggressively the kernel will swap
memory pages.
Higher values increase aggressiveness, lower values
decrease aggressiveness.
The default value is 60.
.TP
.IR /proc/sysrq-trigger " (since Linux 2.4.21)"
Writing a character to this file triggers the same SysRq function as
typing ALT-SysRq-<character> (see the description of
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq ).
This file is normally only writable by
.IR root .
For further details see the Linux kernel source file
.IR Documentation/sysrq.txt .
.TP
.I /proc/sysvipc
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files
.IR msg ", "  sem " and "  shm "."
These files list the System V Interprocess Communication (IPC) objects
(respectively: message queues, semaphores, and shared memory)
that currently exist on the system,
providing similar information to that available via
.BR ipcs (1).
These files have headers and are formatted (one IPC object per line)
for easy understanding.
.BR svipc (7)
provides further background on the information shown by these files.
.TP
.I /proc/tty
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and subdirectories for
tty drivers and line disciplines.
.TP
.I /proc/uptime
This file contains two numbers: the uptime of the system (seconds),
and the amount of time spent in idle process (seconds).
.TP
.I /proc/version
This string identifies the kernel version that is currently running.
It includes the contents of
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/ostype ,
.I /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease
and
.IR /proc/sys/kernel/version .
For example:
.nf
.in -2
.ft CW
Linux version 1.0.9 (quinlan@phaze) #1 Sat May 14 01:51:54 EDT 1994
.ft
.in +2

.SH NOTES
Many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in
the internal format, with subfields terminated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
so you
may find that things are more readable if you use \fIod \-c\fP or \fItr
"\\000" "\\n"\fP to read them.
Alternatively, \fIecho \`cat <file>\`\fP works well.

This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind
of thing that needs to be updated very often.
