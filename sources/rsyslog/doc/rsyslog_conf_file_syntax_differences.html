<h1>Configuration File Syntax Differences</h1>
<p>Rsyslogd uses a slightly different syntax for its
configuration file than the original BSD sources. Originally all
messages of a specific priority and above were forwarded to the log
file. The modifiers "='', "!'' and "!-'' were added to make rsyslogd
more flexible and to use it in a more intuitive manner.<br>
<br>
The original BSD syslogd doesn't understand spaces as separators
between the selector and the action field.<br>
<br>
When compared to syslogd from sysklogd package, rsyslogd offers
additional
<a href="features.html">features</a> (like template
and database support). For obvious reasons, the syntax for defining
such features is available in rsyslogd, only.</p>
