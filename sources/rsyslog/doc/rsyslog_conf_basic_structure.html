<h1>Basic Structure</h1>
<p>Rsyslog supports standard sysklogd's configuration file format
and extends it. So in general, you can take a "normal" syslog.conf and
use it together with rsyslogd. It will understand everything. However,
to use most of rsyslogd's unique features, you need to add extended
configuration directives.</p>
<p>Rsyslogd supports the classical, selector-based rule lines.
They are still at the heart of it and all actions are initiated via
rule lines. A rule lines is any line not starting with a $ or the
comment sign (#). Lines starting with $ carry rsyslog-specific
directives.</p>
<p>Every rule line consists of two fields, a selector field and
an action field. These two fields are separated by one or more spaces
or tabs. The selector field specifies a pattern of facilities and
priorities belonging to the specified action.<br>
<br>
Lines starting with a hash mark ("#'') and empty lines are ignored.
